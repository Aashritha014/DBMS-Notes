Hi, I’m *Aashritha*! 👋🏻  

I’m a third-year Computer Science student at STLW, Hyderabad, India.  

I enjoy exploring machine learning, building websites just for fun, and sharing notes to make exam prep easier (and way less stressful). 🤓☝🏼  

These notes are crafted to make your **college exam prep** easier, smarter, and maybe even a *little fun* ✨
